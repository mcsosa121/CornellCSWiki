title: CS 6110 - Advanced Programming Languages
layout: article
---

## General Information

Like [[CS 4110]], but on steroids. Much more mathematical in nature.

## Prerequisites

You probably want to know [[CS 3110]] and like [[CS 4110]]

## Topics Covered

 - Inductive proof
 - Operational semantics
 - Language features and translation
 - Axiomatic semantics
 - Denotational semantics
 - Type systems

## Workload

(Spring 2011) Not too bad. Six homeworks, a prelim (with in-class and take-home portions), and a final. Homework can be done in groups.

## General Advice

## Testimonials

I took [[CS 3110]] and CS 6110. I feel like this course was "too much information," and I would have been happy with just [[CS 4110]] instead, since some of the proofs were tedious and some of the topics went a bit over my head.

This class was easy but boring.
